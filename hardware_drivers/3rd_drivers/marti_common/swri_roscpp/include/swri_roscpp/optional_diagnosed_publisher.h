  /**
   * The DiagnosedPublisher class is handy, but it has on problem: it can't be
   * turned off.  If you ever stop publishing, it will flag an error because
   * your publish rate is 0.  If you are intentionally not publishing because you
   * don't have any subscribers in order to avoid unnecessary processing, that is
   * inconvenient.
   *
   * This class simply wraps the DiagnosedPublisher and adds a setEnabled method
   * that can be used to enable or disable it.  When disabled, it will simply
   * publish a diagnostic with an "OK" status.
   *
   * In theory it could dynamically determine whether you have subscribers or not and
   * change it status based on that, but that might not be what you want in the event
   * that you don't have subscribers but still have some kind of error to report.
   * @tparam T The type of message being published.
